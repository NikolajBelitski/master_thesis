  <b>Clustering with Reaction-Diffusion equations</b>

  <b>Abstract</b><br/><br/>
In this work I propose a diffusion-reaction equation based model for semi-automatic image clustering. Development of this model was inspired from the biology. The model uses the same principles as competitive Lottka-Volterra equation system, which describes in population dynamic a struggle between different species for re-stricted resources.<br/><br/>
The proposed model consists of two parts: the diffusion part and the reaction part. Main purpose of the diffusion part is a transport function. The reaction part is used as a segmentation mechanic.<br/><br/>
Interaction between the diffusion and reaction parts plays the main role pro- viding a possibility to control the result using different initial configurations. This interaction is a central point of the proposed thesis.<br/><br/>
The big advantage of proposed method is its interactivity and a possibility to use different ”physical” processes for different feature maps. The main disadvantage is its complexity and significant amount of parameters, that nevertheless can be adapted for a particular image domain.<br/><br/>
